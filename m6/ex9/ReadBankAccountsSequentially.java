 * Filename:			ReadBankAccountsSequentially.java
 * Assignment:			Ch 13 Ex 9
 *
 * Description:			A) The Rochester Bank maintains customer records
 * in a random access file. Write an application that creates 10,000 blank
 * records and then allows the user to enter customer account information,
 * include an account number that is 9999 or less, a last name, and a
 * balance. Insert each new record into a data file at a location that is
 * equal to the account number. Assume that the user will not enter invalid
 * account numbers. Force each name to eight characters, padding it with
 * spaces or truncating it if necessary. Also assume that the user will not
 * enter a bank balance greater than 99,000.00. Save the file as
 * CreateBankFile.java.
 *
 * B) Create an application that uses the file created by the user in
 * Exercise 9a and displays all existing accounts in account-number order.
 * Save the file as ReadBankAccountsSequentially.java
 *
 * C) Create an application that uses the file created by the user in
 * Exercise 9a and allows the user to enter an account number to view the
 * account balance. Allow the user to view additional account balances
 * until entering an application-terminating value. Save the file as
 * ReadBankAccountsRandomly.java
