 * Filename:			DisplaySavedPhoneList.java
 * Assignment:			Ch 13 Ex 5
 *
 * Description:			A) Create a program that accepts any number of
 * first names, last names, and associated phone numbers from the keyboard
 * and saves the data to a file. Save the program as WritePhoneList.java.
 * When you execute the program, enter multiple records that have the
 * same first name because you will search for repeated first names in
 * part c of this exercise.
 *
 * B) Write an application that reads the file created by the
 * WritePhoneList application and displays the records. Save the file as
 * DisplaySavedPhoneList.java
 *
 * C) Write an application that allows you to enter any first name and
 * displays all of the last names and phone numbers for records with the
 * given first name. Display an appropriate message if the first name
 * cannot be found in the input file. Save the file as
 * DisplaySelectedNumbers.java
