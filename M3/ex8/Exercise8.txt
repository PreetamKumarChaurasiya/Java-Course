Create a class named "CollegeCourse" that includes data fields that hold the department (for example, ENG), the course number (for example, 101), the credits (for example, 3), and the fee for the course (for example, $360). All of the fields are required as arguments to the constructor, except for the fee, which is calculated at $120 per credit hour. Include a display() method that displays the course data. Create a subclass named "LabCourse" that adds $50 to the course fee. Override the parent class display() method to indicatie that the course is a lab course and to display all the data. Write an application named "UseCourse" that prompts the user for course information. If the user enters a class in any of the following departments, create a "LabCourse: BIO, CHM, CIS, or PHY." If the user enters any other department, create a "CollegeCourse" that does not include a lab fee. Then display the course data. Save the files as "CollegeCourse.java", "LabCourse.java", and "UseCourse.java."
