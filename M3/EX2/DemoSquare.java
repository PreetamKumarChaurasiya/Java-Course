	Description:		Create a class named "Square" that contains data fields 
	for "height", "width", and "surfaceArea", and a method named 
	"computeSurfaceArea()". Create a child class named "Cube." "Cube" contains 
	an additional data field named "depth", and a "computeSurfaceArea()" method 
	that overrides the parent method. Write an application that instantiates a
	"Square" object and a "Cube" object and displays the surface areas of the 
	objects. Save the files as "Cube.java", "Square.java", and 
	"DemoSquare.java."
	
	Formulas:
	Surface Area of a Rectangle = hw
	Surface Area of a Rectangular Prism = 2hw + 2wd + 2hd
