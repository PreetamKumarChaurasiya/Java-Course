 * Description:			Write an application named GoTooFar in which you 
 * declare an array of five integers and store five values in the array. 
 * Write a try block in which you loop to display each successive element of 
 * the array, increasing a subscript by 1 on each pass through the loop. Create
 * a catch block that catches the eventual ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException and 
 * displays the message, "Now you've gone too far." Save the file as GoTooFar.java
