 * Filename:			AccountArray.java
 * Assignment: 			Ch 11 Ex 2
 * 
 * Description:		A) Create an abstract class named "Account" for a bank.
 * Include an integer field for the account number and a double field 
 * for the account balance. Also include a constructor that requires an 
 * account number and that sets the balance to 0.0. Include a set method
 * for the balance. Also include two abstract get methods -- one for 
 * each field. Create two child classes of Account: Checking and Savings.
 * Within the Checking class, the get method displays the String 
 * "Checking Account Information", the account number, and the balance. 
 * Within the Savings class, add a field to hold the interest rate, and 
 * require the Savings constructor to accept an argument for the value 
 * of the interest rate. The Savings get method displays the String 
 * "Savings Account Information", the account number, the balance, and 
 * the interest rate. Write an application that demonstrates you can 
 * instantiate and display both Checking and Savings objects. Save the 
 * files as Account.java, Checking.java, Savings.java, and 
 * DemoAccounts.java
 * 
 * B) Write an application named AccountArray in which you enter data for
 * a mix of 10 Checking and Savings accounts. Use a for loop to display 
 * the data. Save the file as AccountArray.java
