 * 	Description:
 * 	Write an application that contains an array of 10 multiple-choice quiz
 * 	questions related to your favorite hobby. Each question contains three
 * 	answer choices. Also create an array that holds the correct answer to 
 * 	each question -- A, B, or C. Display each question and verify that the 
 * 	user enters only A, B, or C as the answer -- if not, keep prompting the
 * 	user until a valid response is entered. If the user responds to a 
 * 	question correctly, display "Correct!"; otherwise, display "The 
 * 	correct answer is" and the letter of the correct answer. After the user
 * 	answers all the questions, display the number of correct and incorrect 
 * 	answers. Save the file as Quiz.java
